    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As someone with a keen interest in functional programming, I have become
      proficient in several languages, like Clojure, F#, Scala, and Elixir. My main
      professional focus is on back-end development, such as API design and
      implementation. I also have experience in building, testing, and deploying data
      pipelines for automated analysis.
