career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an experienced software developer dedicated to functional programming.
      My main expertise lies in **Clojure**, which I've used extensively
      for back-end development. In this role, I've designed APIs,
      built, tested, and deployed data pipelines for automated analysis.

      My interest in functional programming extends to personal projects.
      I've developed cross-platform mobile applications in **F#** and created
      libraries in **Scala**, **Elixir**, and **Elm**. These projects reflect my
      personal exploration of these languages.

      Professionally, I also have experience with **Terraform** for infrastructure
      and **Kubernetes** for container management. While my primary focus is not
      DevOps, these skills are a significant part of my technical toolkit.
